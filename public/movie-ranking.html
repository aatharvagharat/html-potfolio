<h1>The Best Movies According to Atharva</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shyam Singha Roy</h3>
<p> Emotional love drama. 
    My rating : 3.25/5
    Performances : 
    Nani once again proved why he is known as Natural Star. He came with a realistic performance to steal the show. Nani looked as young and charming as Vasu who aspires to be a filmmaker. He looked playful and jovial and youthful in the role of Vasu. He lived in the role of Shyam Singha Roy and leaves all spellbound with his performance.</p>
<h3>Kantara</h3>
<p>Truly epic. Marvel of film-making. Should be a case study. There are not many movies that become a method of teaching or make even seasoned movie directors look like amateurs, and Kantara is one such film that redefines the genre and sets new standards for what a movie can achieve.</p>
<h3>KGF</h3>
<p>Best Movie I Have Seen</p>
